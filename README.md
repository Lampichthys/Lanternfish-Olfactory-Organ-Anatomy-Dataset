Supplementary Tables for Dissertation Chapter on olfactory organ anatomy across deep-sea lanternfishes and blackchins.
- Supplementary Table 1.
	Myctophiform specimens used in this study. Sex was determined when possible, blank cells in measurement columns mean that measurement was not taken. An 'X' is associated with any specimen that was used in the histological and SEM analyses.
	
- Supplementary Table 2.
	Lanternfishes species olfactory data used in analyses pertaining to ecological and behavioral factors. Migration acronyms include: DVM, diel vertical migration where species migrate towards the surface at night; PDVM, partial diel vertical migration where only part of the population migrates or has a bimodal distribution; NoDVM, the species does not migrate; IDVM, inverse diel vertical migration where species migrate towards the surface during the day. Feeding categories include: 0, predominately zooplanktivorous with a diet composition mainly containing planktonic crustaceans including amphipods, copepods, decapods, euphausiids, and ostracods; 1, predominately zooplanktivorous but diet includes additional prey types including chaetognaths, larvaceans, molluscs, and polychaete; 2, predominately zooplanktivorous but become partially piscivorous; 3, specialize on a particular prey group (e.g., only piscivorous, only feed on pteropods). Spawning categories include: 0, restricted spawners that only spawn one to two times a year; 1, extended spawners that spawn up to four to six months a year; 2, year-round spawners that spawn throughout the year.
			
- Supplementary Table 3.
	List of myctophiform specimens in which the left and right olfactory organs were removed to histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy. An X indicates presence of cell type, a ? indicates possible presence of cell type, an -  indicates the olfactory organ was damaged, and an empty cell indicates type was not seen in this study but does not indicate that it is not present in the species. Abbreviations as follows: Ciliated OSN (ci), approximate average epithelial thickness (ET), microvillous OSN (mv), non-sensory ciliated cell (nsc), and crypt OSN (crypt). A + sign indicates female, a * sign indicates male.
			
- Supplementary Table 4.
	Results from the Tukey post test assessing significant differences in olfactory organ length between genera using the residuals from the phylogenetically corrected and specimen length standardized linear regression. Only significant values are listed.
